## 🎯 Key Architecture Decisions

### 1. **Two-Team Structure**

**TEAM A: Service Engineer**
- Responsibilities: Backend logic, database, analytics, integrations
- Tech Stack: Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Azure Face API
- Deliverables: Analytics engine, face recognition, email alerts, API

**TEAM B: Plugin Engineer**
- Responsibilities: NX VMS integration, video processing, reliability
- Tech Stack: C++, NX SDK, CMake, HTTP client
- Deliverables: Enhanced plugin, fall detection trigger, zone management

### 2. **Communication Pipeline**

```
Plugin (C++)
    ↓ HTTP API (Port 18000)
Service (Python/FastAPI)
    ↓ Database / External APIs
Data Layer (PostgreSQL + Azure + SendGrid + Etc.)
```

**Key API Endpoints:**
- `POST /detect` - Frame inference
- `POST /analytics/fall-detection` - Fall detection
- `POST /analytics/zone-check` - Zone validation
- `GET/POST /person` - Person management
- `GET /health` - Health check

### 3. **Data Storage Strategy**

**Primary Database: PostgreSQL**
- Person profiles with face embeddings
- Event logs with full audit trail
- Zone definitions and boundaries
- Tracking data for real-time queries

**Third-Party Services:**
- **Face Recognition:** Azure Face API (accuracy + GDPR compliance)
- **Email Alerts:** SendGrid or AWS SES (cost-effective + reliable)
- **Analytics:** ELK Stack (open-source) or Datadog (cloud)
- **SMS (Optional):** Twilio (for critical alerts)

### 4. **Deployment Model**

```
Production Setup:
├── Load Balancer (Nginx)
├── Service Container x2 (replicas)
├── PostgreSQL (with replication)
├── Redis (caching)
└── Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana + ELK)

Docker-based with auto-recovery, health checks, and scaling
```

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: What if one team gets blocked?**
A: Daily standups should catch this early. Architecture is designed for parallel work with clear interfaces. Unblock via async communication (Slack) or schedule sync call.

**Q: How do we handle API changes?**
A: API contract is reviewed by both teams. Breaking changes require discussion. Version APIs to support gradual migration.

**Q: What about testing across teams?**
A: Integration tests live in separate repo/folder. CI/CD runs cross-team tests. Regular integration testing (daily).

**Q: How do we scale to multiple cameras?**
A: Plugin handles per-camera frame streams. Service is stateless and can be load-balanced. Database is centralized. Multi-instance setup documented in docker-compose.

**Q: What about failover and redundancy?**
A: Docker setup with load balancer. Database replication for HA. Health checks and auto-restart. Disaster recovery procedures documented.

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

This architecture provides:

✅ **Professional Structure** - Clear separation of concerns between two teams  
✅ **Scalable Design** - Can grow from 5 cameras to 100+ cameras  
✅ **Production Ready** - Monitoring, alerting, backup, and recovery built-in  
✅ **Maintainable Code** - Templates, patterns, and documentation  
✅ **Secure** - Data protection, encryption, GDPR compliance  
✅ **Reliable** - Error handling, fallback mechanisms, redundancy  
✅ **Cost-Effective** - Open-source components + strategic third-party services  

The two-team model enables parallel development while maintaining tight integration through well-defined APIs. The 8-week timeline is realistic and includes buffer for unexpected issues.

**You're ready to begin implementation. Good luck! 🚀**
